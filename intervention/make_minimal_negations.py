"""Build in-distribution minimal-pair negations of the first sentence.

The trained model keys on a tiny, rigid verdict vocabulary that the synthetic
training data actually used:

    wrong       -> "morally wrong" / "is wrong"
    acceptable  -> "perfectly fine" / "morally acceptable"

The Azure negations were confounded: they used out-of-vocabulary synonyms
("inappropriate", "immoral") and conditional escape clauses ("...unless..."),
which the model does not read as a clean stance flip. This script instead flips
*only* the canonical verdict phrase in sentence 1 and leaves every other token
(and the entire body) byte-identical, producing a clean minimal pair.

Output schema matches negated_cot.jsonl (the ``paraphrase`` field holds the
rewritten first sentence) so it is a drop-in for intervene_cot.py:

    python intervention/intervene_cot.py \
        --intervention negate_s1 \
        --generations data/evaluation_data/qwen/ETHICS/qwen05b_v1.jsonl \
        --paraphrases data/intervention_data/qwen/ETHICS/interventions/negated_minimal_cot.jsonl \
        --output data/intervention_data/qwen/ETHICS/qwen05b_v1_negate_s1_minimal.jsonl
